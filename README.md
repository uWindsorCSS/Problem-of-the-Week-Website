About
---------

Each week the Computer Science Society comes up with a new computer 
science related problem dubbed the "Problem of the week." Students 
who solve said problem recieve a ballot that is entered for a draw 
at the end of the month where they can win some pretty sweet prizes.

This web-app was created to help make the process easier for all those 
involved (solvers and checkers) and hopefully get more students involved.
